    <h1>Terms and Conditions for PlutoWallet</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: June 20, 2024</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") outline the general terms and conditions governing your use of the
      "PlutoWallet" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any associated products and services
      (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between you ("User", "you", or
      "your") and the developer of the Mobile Application ("Operator", "we", "us", or "our"). If you are entering into
      this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you confirm that you have the authority to bind that
      entity to this Agreement. In such cases, the terms "User", "you", or "your" will refer to the entity. If you lack
      such authority or disagree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept it and are prohibited from
      accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and
      Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
      You recognize that this Agreement forms a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and
      not physically signed by you, governing your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>To simplify things for our users, we have included this section that summarizes the key points of this Agreement.
      It is crucial to understand that by accepting this Agreement, you are accepting the full terms and conditions, not
      just this summary. PlutoWallet offers self-hosted wallet services for managing assets within the Polkadot
      ecosystem. By building our application from source code, downloading it from any app store, running it on any
      platform, creating or importing a wallet, or visiting our website, you agree to our Terms, so please read them
      carefully. These terms detail the permitted uses of PlutoWallet, the various licenses we grant you, and the
      licenses you grant us. For any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please contact us at our <a
        href="https://web.telegram.org/a/#-4108012041">Telegram</a>
      account. If you disagree with this Agreement or any changes to it, you should immediately cease using our
      Services.</p>

    <h2>Accounts and Membership</h2>
    <p>By creating a wallet in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining its security and are fully
      accountable for all activities that occur under it and any other actions taken in connection with it. We do not
      have access to any wallet-related information on our side, nor can we provide it to any third party. All such
      information is stored locally on your device(s), and you bear full responsibility for its (their) safety. Your
      wallet keys are not backed up with other data, so if you delete the Mobile Application, it will be impossible to
      restore your keys from a backup.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Resources</h2>
    <p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites or other mobile
      applications), we do not, directly or indirectly, imply any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or
      affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or
      evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their
      resources. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other
      third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource
      accessed through a link in the Mobile Application. Linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.
    </p>

      Services or Content:</p>

      <li>to upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way that
        will affect the functionality or operation of the Mobile Application and Services, third-party products and
        services, or the Internet;</li>
      <li>to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape;</li>
      <li>for any obscene or immoral purpose; or</li>
      <li>to interfere with or circumvent the security features of the Mobile Application and Services, third-party
        products and services, or the Internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>"Intellectual Property Rights" refers to all present and future rights conferred by statute, common law, or
      equity in or relating to any copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents, inventions, goodwill, the
      right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to use, and all other intellectual property rights,
      whether registered or unregistered. This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by the
      Operator or third parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property remain (as between the
      parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the
      Mobile Application and Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or its licensors. Other
      trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Mobile Application and Services may be
      the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Mobile Application and Services grants you no right or
      license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator's or third parties' trademarks.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
      agents, suppliers, or licensors will not be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive,
      cover, or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue, sales,
      goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, or loss of
      business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract,
      tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to
      the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
      law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and
      licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid
      in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one-month period before the first event or occurrence giving rise to
      such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any
      losses or fails of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
      suppliers, and licensors harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, or costs, including
      reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third-party allegations, claims,
      actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your content, your use of
      the Mobile Application and Services, or any willful misconduct on your part.</p>

    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall apply and be binding only to
      the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited so that they will not
      render this Agreement illegal, invalid, or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this
      Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the
      intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
      respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full
      force and effect.</p>


    <h2> Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p> The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be
      governed by the substantive and procedural laws of the Czech Republic without regard to its rules on conflicts or
      choice of law. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the
      courts located in the Czech Republic, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You waive
      any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations
      Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
      Changes and Amendments.</p>
