        <h1>Terms and Conditions for PlutoWallet</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: June 20, 2024</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") outline the general terms and conditions governing your use of the "PlutoWallet" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any associated products and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between you ("User", "you", or "your") and the developer of the Mobile Application ("Operator", "we", "us", or "our"). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you confirm that you have the authority to bind that entity to this Agreement. In such cases, the terms "User", "you", or "your" will refer to the entity. If you lack such authority or disagree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept it and are prohibited from accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You recognize that this Agreement forms a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and not physically signed by you, governing your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>To simplify things for our users, we have included this section that summarizes the key points of this Agreement. It is crucial to understand that by accepting this Agreement, you are accepting the full terms and conditions, not just this summary. PlutoWallet offers self-hosted wallet services for managing assets within the Polkadot ecosystem. By building our application from source code, downloading it from any app store, running it on any platform, creating or importing a wallet, or visiting our website, you agree to our Terms, so please read them carefully. These terms detail the permitted uses of PlutoWallet, the various licenses we grant you, and the licenses you grant us. For any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please contact us at our Telegram account. If you disagree with this Agreement or any changes to it, you should immediately cease using our Services.</p>

        <h2>Accounts and Membership</h2>
        <p>By creating a wallet in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining its security and are fully accountable for all activities that occur under it and any other actions taken in connection with it. We do not have access to any wallet-related information on our side, nor can we provide it to any third party. All such information is stored locally on your device(s), and you bear full responsibility for its (their) safety. Your wallet keys are not backed up with other data, so if you delete the Mobile Application, it will be impossible to restore your keys from a backup.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Resources</h2>
        <p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites or other mobile applications), we do not, directly or indirectly, imply any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource accessed through a link in the Mobile Application. Linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
        <p>You may opt to receive push notifications from PlutoWallet for updates related to your account balances, network events, and PlutoWallet announcements. To receive push notifications, you must enable the service by going to "Settings," selecting "Push notifications," and tapping on "Enable notifications."</p>

This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by the Operator or third parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property remain (as between the parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Mobile Application and Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Mobile Application and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Mobile Application and Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator's or third parties' trademarks.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors will not be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover, or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, or loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one-month period before the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, or costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third-party allegations, claims, actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your content, your use of the Mobile Application and Services, or any willful misconduct on your part.</p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall apply and be binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid, or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
         
        
        <h2> Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p> The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of the Czech Republic without regard to its rules on conflicts or choice of law. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in the Czech Republic, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
